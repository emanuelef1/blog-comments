Dead sea is totally safe for humans. In fact, it is one the safest sea if you want to learn swimming.

Why?

Because it has very high saline water and saline water has great buoyancy.

In fact, it is said that you can never drown in dead sea.

But at the same time salinity makes it unsafe for acquatic organisms. Hence the name Dead Sea.
